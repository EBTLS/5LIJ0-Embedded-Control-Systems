# Embedded Control Systems Project

> Jiaxuan Zhang, Yiting Li



This repo contains 3 assignments from TU Eindhoven 5LIJ0 Embedded Control Systems Course given by Professor. Dip Goswami

# Assignment 1

Design 8 Real-Time Controller works on an Dual Rotary System and an DC Motor System and different sampling time and sensor-to-actuator delay considerations. 

The project requires us to first write code in MATLAB and then use MIL-PIL-HIL simulations. The simulation systems works on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board.

The design is in the folder `Assignment_1`

# Assignment 2

This is a individual assignment, so that you can see two different folders: `Assignment_2_JXZ` and `Assignment_2_LYD`

# Assignment 3
