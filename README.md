# Embedded Control Systems Project

This repo contains 3 assignments from TU Eindhoven 5LIJ0 Embedded Control Systems Course given by Professor. Dip Goswami

**Lecturer**: Professor. Dip Goswami

**Content:** This course mainly focus on designing real-time control systems and some other industrial control systems with real-time requirements

**Team Members**: Jiaxuan Zhang, Yiting Li

There are three assignments in this course

# Assignment 1

Design 8 Real-Time Controller works on an Dual Rotary System and an DC Motor System and different sampling time and sensor-to-actuator delay considerations. 

The project requires us to first write code in MATLAB and then use MIL-PIL-HIL simulations. The simulation systems works on a PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board.

The design is in the folder `Assignment_1`

# Assignment 2

This is a individual assignment, so that you can see two different folders: `Assignment_2_JXZ` and `Assignment_2_LYD`

# Assignment 3

In Assignment 3, we need to design system architecture and controller for the LKAS braking systems in two scenarios:

1. Use OSEK MCU, TDMA MCU and CAN bus, with a budget of 850 Euro (mainly designed by JXZHANG)
2. Use OSEK MCU, TDMA MCU and FlexRay bus, with a budget of 850 Euro (mainly designed by YTLi)

All of the project are modelled, tested and examined in the INCHron Tool-Suite
